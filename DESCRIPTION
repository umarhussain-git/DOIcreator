Description: DOIcreator is an R package that reads Word documents containing bibliographic references,
    searches for their corresponding DOIs via the CrossRef API, and appends the DOIs directly to the references.
    It supports parallel processing for faster retrieval and outputs a new Word document with numbered references
    including DOIs.
